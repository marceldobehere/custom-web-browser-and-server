### My Custom Webbrowser and Server

I am learning da Java and so I decided to make a Webbrowser and Server which doesn't use html or css or http and stuff.
So instead theres TCP-Sockets with custom protocols, ROML, and ROSL (working on it).

It's in a very early stage, but I just decided to upload the beta builds.


Also RoSL is in a somewhat working stage and ya can find the docs for both langs in the data/docs folder.

But I'm still working on RoSL since its missing a lot of stuff (including interacting with the actual website, working on the browser, having access to network protocols, adding a lot of string methods, etc)
